Change History
==============

1.6 (unreleased)
----------------

- Disable Gzip compression for our Plone sites by default.  If they sit behind
  a webserver, which all sites should, then we're wasting compute resources
  gzipping on the Zope site.

1.5.12 (2011-07-20)
-------------------

- Enable caching for LDAP and acl_users via plone.app.ldap GS profile
  [David]
- Fix issue with importing LDAP against plone.app.ldap 1.2.5+ (interfaces
  are automatically disabled unless otherwise specified)
  [David]
- Adding cache paramter to LDAP GenericSetup profile to use RAMCache
  [David]
- Removing custom search_form from this theme.  It conflicts with Plone 4.1rc3
  and we don't need the customisation any more.
  [David]

1.5.11 (2011-06-20)
-------------------

- Updating login form for Plone 4.1rc2.  Previous compatibility is unknown.
  [David]

1.5.10 (2011-05-27)
-------------------

- Making theme tab only available to managers
  [David]
- Fixing issue with background for menus not showing on default theme
  [David]

  a copyright notice on the map.
  [David]


1.5.9 (2011-05-09)
------------------

- Upgraded GS profile and fixed URL in About Me action
- Fixed minor issue with CSS not selecting an inactive drop-down menu
- Added My Folder action; this is very useful on sites
- Added .card CSS declaration for use on the member search results page

1.5.8 (2011-03-25)
------------------

- Fixing redundancy in CSS for portal messages
- Increasing font size in overlays
- Defaulting to many users for the portal, since we use LDAP.  We need to
 do this as Plone now defaults to listing all portal users on the users
 overview page.  Not bad if only a few LDAP users, but anything more than a
 handful equals death.  Let's make this our default option and instruct users
 to add people to groups before assigning roles.
- Adding CSS for #site-title.  We can now use this as an <a href="/"> in our
 portal logo viewlet to look like other JCU sites.
- Overriding the group membership page via overrides.zcml
- Allowing sorting on group members page (restructuring table)
- Reordering search box on group members page

1.5.7 (2011-03-15)
------------------

- Updating TinyMCE GS profile to suit new version

 has a problem.

 [David]
- Changing LDAP plugin to not be enabled for modification of groups
 or users.  This should improve performance and stop issues when changing
 principals.
 [David]
- Fixed issue with TinyMCE toolbars being too long.  This should
 be enough unless we add more buttons to the toolbar :/ .
 [David]
- Depended on plone.app.caching.  We really need this to fix Google
 Chrome's dodginess and for speed.
 [David]

 bug, but I've added manually intervention for the moment.

- Updated various viewlets to bring into line with Plone 4 (eg logo)

- Removed various viewlets as Plone 4 provides the same as default 
 (eg global sections)
 [David]
- Added wrapper within the footer structure for margin to apply 
 [David]
- Replaced old CSS with that from Sunburst theme; still needs customisation
 [David]
- Removed main_template customisations and our theme now extends off 
 Sunburst to get divs OOTB rather than tables
